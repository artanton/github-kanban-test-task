# GitHub Issues Board

## Overview  

**GitHub Issues Board** is a web application that allows users to fetch and manage issues from any public GitHub repository. Built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **React**, this app provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for organizing issues into three categories:  

- **ToDo** (new issues)  
- **In Progress** (open issues with an assignee)  
- **Done** (closed issues)

</div>

User preferences, including issue positions and order, are **persisted across sessions** to maintain custom arrangements.  

## Features  

âœ” **Search by Repository** â€“ Enter a GitHub repository URL and fetch issues dynamically.  
âœ” **Drag-and-Drop Support** â€“ Easily move issues between categories.  
âœ” **Persistent State** â€“ Changes to issue order and status are saved across searches and sessions.  
âœ” **Direct Links** â€“ Quick access to the repository and owner's profile.  
âœ” **Optimized Performance** â€“ Powered by Vite for fast development and builds.  
âœ” **Redux for State Management** â€“ Efficient issue tracking and updates.

## How It Works
1. Enter a GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/facebook/react) in the input field and press Load.
2. The app fetches issues from the repository using the GitHub API.
3. Issues are categorized into:
 - ToDo â€“ All new issues.
 - In Progress â€“ Open issues with an assignee.
 - Done â€“ Closed issues.
4. Drag and drop issues between columns to update their status and order.
5. Changes are saved between sessions.
6. Click on the repository name or owner's profile to visit them on GitHub.
Enjoy building with GitHub Issues Board! ðŸš€
