Open http://localhost:3000/ and observe error\n\nLink to code example: https://github.com/darthmaim-reproductions/vercel-next.js-72034\n\n\n## The current behavior\n\nWhen using `cloneElement` in a client component, and the children is an async server component, this error is thrown:\n> Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.\n> Check the render method of `ClientComponent`.\n\nWhen the server component is not `async` (or a client component), this just works.\n\nAdditionally, adding this line to the client component also makes this work:\n\n```ts\nif(children.$$typeof === Symbol.for('react.lazy')) { children = use(children._payload); }\n```\n\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nSince `cloneElement` works for client components and non-async server components, I expected this to work with async server components as well.\n\n\n## Additional context\n\nWith react 18 the children was reported as `<Lazy/>` in react-dev-tools and `cloneElement` was working, now it is shown as `{ $$typeof: Symbol(react.lazy) }` (when not using cloneElement to avoid the error).\n\nI initially reported this is in the Next.js repo (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/72034), but I keep running into this bug and suspect its a react bug and not related to Next.js.",

Create a simple React component:\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  console.log(1);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"https://cdn.example.com/%CE%B1%AA%E1%BC%E1%B2%E1%AB%CE%B1%E1%A7%E1_600x600.png\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n2. Render this component within a React application.\n\n3. Open the Developer Tools in a Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome) and observe that the console displays 1.\n\n4. Close and reopen the Developer Tools.\n\n5. Notice that the console log output (1) is no longer present.\n\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-dev-forked-gtkl7p\n\n## The current behavior\nAfter reopening the Developer Tools, the previously logged output is missing. This issue occurs specifically within the React rendering environment and only in Chromium-based browsers; it does not occur in Safari, Firefox, or when using a plain HTML <img> tag.\n\n## The expected behavior\nThe console output from console.log(1) should persist regardless of whether the Developer Tools are closed and reopened, even if the image fails to load due to encoding issues.\n\n## Additional Context:\n- The problem is observed when the image URL includes characters encoded in EUC-KR rather than UTF-8.\n- Although the issue might be influenced by how Chromium handles resource load errors, the fact that it manifests only in a React environment raises the possibility of an interplay between React's rendering lifecycle and the browser’s error handling.\n- This bug adversely affects the debugging experience by causing unexpected loss of console output during development.\n",

When the direction changes we need to do another render in the new direction (returning previous or next).\r\n\r\nTo determine direction we store the position we started at and anything moving to a lower value (left/up) is \"previous\" direction (`false`) and anything else is \"next\" (`true`) direction.\r\n\r\nFor the very first render we won't know which direction you're going since you're still on the initial position. It's useful to start the render to allow the view transition to take control before anything shifts around so we start from the original position. This is not guaranteed though if the render suspends.\r\n\r\nFor now we start the first render by guessing the direction such as if we know that prev/next are the same as current. With the upcoming auto start mode we can guess more accurately there before we start. We can also add explicit APIs to `startGesture` but ideally it wouldn't matter. Ideally we could just start after the first change in direction from the starting point.",

        "body": "Currently cleanup functions returned by `useEffect` hook are not executed on page unload, and for a good reason - most cleanups do not need to be called when the page is closing. But there are some situations, when it is useful. To name but a few:\n- Calling `close()` method on [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) or [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) instances;\n- Performing requests with [Beacon API](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API) or fetch with [`keepalive = true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#keepalive).\n\nCurrently, React does not have a built-in solution for this. It is possible to write something like:\n```typescript\nfunction useReliableEffect(f: EffectCallback, deps: unknown[]) {\n    useEffect(() => {\n        const cleanup = f()\n        const newCleanup = (typeof cleanup === \"function\") ? () => {\n            window.removeEventListener(\"unload\", newCleanup!)  // If cleanup is executed already, it should not run on page unload\n            cleanup()\n        } : undefined\n\n        if (typeof newCleanup === \"function\") {\n            window.addEventListener(\"unload\", newCleanup)\n        }\n        return newCleanup\n\n    }, deps);  // ESLint react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n}\n```\n\nbut this solution does not have an advantage of statically checked dependencies. The alternative would be:\n```typescript\nfunction useReliableEffect(f: EffectCallback) {  // Take only callback\n    useEffect(() => {\n        // Same code as above\n    }, [f]);\n}\n\n// Caller\nconst f = useCallback(  // Delegate dependency management to caller\n    () => {/*effect code*/}, [/*appropriate deps*/]\n)\nuseReliableEffect(f)\n```\nbut there is no guarantee that the caller will not forget to use `useCallback`\n\n\nMy proposal is to add an optional flag to the hook:\n```typescript\nfunction useEffect(callback, deps?, cleanupOnUnload? = false)\n```\nthat would make cleanup run on page onload.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\n**React version:** (N/A - Documentation Bug)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open [React Hooks Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) on a small screen (mobile/tablet).  \n2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.  \n3. Observe that the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons are misaligned. \"Previous\" appears higher on the left, while \"Next\" is lower on the right.  \n\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\n**Link to code example:** (N/A - Issue is in React Docs UI)\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## The current behavior\n\nOn small screens, the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons at the bottom of the page are not aligned in a single line. \"Previous\" appears on the left but slightly higher, while \"Next\" is lower on the right. This affects navigation UI consistency.\n\nIt does not seem intentional, as navigation buttons are typically aligned in a straight line for better UX.\n\n### Screenshot:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c5118c-3f5f-4ee9-8f64-c6bbcba3ab0e)\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nBoth buttons should be properly aligned in the same row, ensuring a consistent UI across different screen sizes.\n",

        "body": "React version: Affects all versions, but particularly relevant for React 19+.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a simple React component using useState.\n2. Update the state and observe that the entire component re-renders, even though only part of the UI actually changes.\n\nCode example:\n\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  console.log(\"Component re-rendered\");\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\n👉 Problem: Every time count updates, the entire Counter component re-renders, even though only `<p>{count}</p>` needs to change.\n\n## The current behavior\n1. React re-renders the entire component when state changes, even if only a small part of the UI is affected.\n2. Developers must manually optimize performance using memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback().\n3. This leads to larger bundle sizes and harder-to-maintain code.\n\n## The expected behavior\n🚀 Only `<p>{count}</p>` updates, instead of re-rendering the whole component.\n📦 No need for memo, useMemo, or useCallback, making React simpler to use.\n⚡ Improved performance and smaller bundle size without extra manual optimizations.\n✅ Use a single useState or useRef to keep things simple but effective.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from the React team and the community! 🚀🔥",

Other attributes like `data-name` are still on the element. \n\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nThe `name` shouldn't be deleted when clicking on the input.

The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9.

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\nReact Dev Tools injects its own js code (installHook.js) and then tries to download the source map of its own code. Since my app does not know about installHook.js it can not generate the source map. So far, no harm done. But then, I get that huge warning in my console. And I google... And I chatGPT, dive into the deep realms of generating source maps, ...and after wasting an hour... find out by digging into the source code of the dev tools, that someone was too lazy to filter out your own files. The internet is full of this problem. It is time to fix it.\n\nReact version: 19.0.0\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a react app\n2. install react developer tools\n3. execute npm run dev\n4. open the console of the browser\n5. be annoyed by a warning, that the sourceMap of installHook.js cannot be found or is invalid\n\nLink to code example: I tried using CodeSandbox, CodeSandbox itself is filling my console with warnings... Just execute a good old google query: https://www.google.com/search?q=installhook.js.map\n\n## Workaround\nServe your own installHook.js.map file. I put one in the public directory of my react app. Contents:\n```\n{\n  \"version\": 3,\n  \"file\": \"installHook.js\",\n  \"sources\": [\"installHook.js\"],\n  \"sourcesContent\": [\"\"],\n  \"mappings\": \"\"\n}\n``` \n\n## The current behavior\n\n<img width=\"717\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59627e18-dd6a-4ded-ad25-fbde517012a9\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\nI don't see a warning.

However, when the child component additionally wraps its own Suspense, the loading succeeds (lines 1 & 3).\n\n<img width=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f709312c-454c-414c-bec5-7b9a6eb5f401\" />\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nAll lazy components should render\n\n<img width=\"111\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49554342-07d4-4e2e-9259-ea30d1011cfc\" />\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\nLink to code example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-yafxnrot?file=src%2FApp.tsx\n\n\n```ts\nfunction Child({ n }: { n: number }) {\n  return <div>Child {n}</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Layout2({ withSuspense = false }: { withSuspense?: boolean }) {\n  const LazyChild = useMemo(() => lazy(async () => ({ default: Child })), []);\n  if (withSuspense) {\n    return (\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Suspense 2</div>}>\n        <LazyChild n={2} />\n      </Suspense>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return <LazyChild n={2} />;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Layout() {\n  const LazyChild = useMemo(() => lazy(async () => ({ default: Child })), []);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Suspense 1</div>}>\n        <LazyChild n={1} />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Suspense 2</div>}>\n        <Layout2 />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Suspense 2</div>}>\n        <Layout2 withSuspense />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Layout />;\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n```ts\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n```",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

As a primitive type in JS, I believe it can be implemented using existing Primitive kind. ~~However, in the AST obtained via Babel, the value of BigIntLiteral is also of string type. Therefore, a new field is needed to distinguish it from a actual string. I've temporarily named it isBigInt, as the name is quite intuitive.~~\r\n\r\nI realized that I can convert the value corresponding to BigIntLiteral to the bigint type directly, which would eliminate the need for a new field to identify it.\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\nAdded a test. I tried modifying the existing test cases, but the results looked messy, so I added new test cases instead.\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",
